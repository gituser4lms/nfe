Design Notes
===============

The .stm format

STM files are manifests that are used as proxy descriptors for remotely dispatched medias. 
the effective media file may be stored into an extra storage out of control of Moodle and
may be delivered from a streamed URL. the manifest file should be usually built by the MPlayer 
module, after a media upload. the manifest file is an XML file with a simple internal schema :

<XML version="1.0">
<Video>
    <Source>
        <streamer>wowza</streamer>
        <streamerurl>rtmp://medias.mysite/com</streamerurl>
        <appication>/vod</application>
        <clip>0</clip>
        <location>mp4:streamedfile.mp4</location>
    </Source>
</Video>
